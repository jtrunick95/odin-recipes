    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe will show you the CORRECT way to cook chicken breast. No more boring dry chicken breasts for you!</p>
        <p>This recipe is for a southwestern, blackened chicken breast. Feel free to use your favorite seasonings in place. The real magic here is how it is cooked.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast of any size</li>
            <li>High smoke point oil like vegetable, avocado, or pure olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Thyme </li>
            <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>Chili Powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry chicken breast with paper towel. Get it as dry as possible. This will ensure we get a nice crust.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breast between saran wrap and smash with a mallet or something heavy like a cast iron pan to even out the chicken breast. It should now be an even thickness. This will allow the chicken to cook evenly, resulting in a more moist and juicy breast.</li>
            <li>Heat cast iron pan to medium high </li>
            <li>While pan heats, season chicken with all seasonings</li>
            <li>Add oil to pan</li>
            <li>Once oil just barely begins to smoke, add chicken to pan and press firmly on chicken</li>
            <li>Allow chicken to cook for about 3-4 minutes depending on thickness</li>
            <li>Flip chicken and cook until internal temperature reaches 145-155</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and wrap in foil and let rest for 5 minutes. This is where carry over cooking comes in. The chicken will continue cooking and the temperature will continue to rise.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
